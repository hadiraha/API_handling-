# API_handling-
This is my first attempt to make an endpoint and frontend to interact and fetch data from my last APARAT_PROJECT.

In this project we can make an endpoint by FastAPI to make transactions with data stored in mySQL, by our client.
I didn't have enough resources (I mean without bitting around the bush I don't have moneyðŸ˜‚ ) to dedicate a real server and deploy it to store my database and lunch my webservice on a global URL.
